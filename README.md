###About MortgageLender-Review.com

####Design Approach

The MortgageLender-Review.com application utlitizes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureauâ€™s (CFPB) publicly available - Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data. The CFPB's Open Tech website provides the API to obtain the JSON source of the HMDA dataset.
The MortgageLender.com application is mostly built as a Client side application utlizing web service to query the HMDA dataset. The application also uses the open source version of ASP.net. 

####Development Approach
The team used GitHub version control and Trello boards for the agile planning, Visual Studio online for continous integration and deployment, Azure for hosting, Jasmine and karma for javascript unit test and Gulp for running tasks like build,clean, minification and starting the web server. The application is developed using the AngularJS on client side and ASP.Net on the server side. 
This is a single page application and all the calls are made to the web service directly to get the data. There is no data stored in our server or manipulated anything from server side. Entire application logic is written in client side angular js. 
We used angular charts to generate charts and graphs. This used d3j javascript library to render the charts. We used bootstrap for making our application responsive. The charts and graphs generated by angular charts are svg based and are responsive.
