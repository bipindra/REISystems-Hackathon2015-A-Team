###About MortgageLender-Review.com

####Design Approach

The MortgageLender-Review.com application utlitizes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureauâ€™s (CFPB) publicly available - Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data. The CFPB's Open Tech website provides the API to obtain the JSON source of the HMDA dataset.
The MortgageLender.com application is mostly built as a Client side application utlizing web service to query the HMDA dataset. The application also uses the open source/ cross platform version ASP.net 5. 

This application is designed in SPA approach so that it can be easily converted into hybrid mobile applications. 

####Development Approach
The team used GitHub version control and Trello boards for the agile planning, Visual Studio online for continous integration and deployment, Azure for hosting, Jasmine and karma for javascript unit test and Gulp for running tasks like build,clean, minification and starting the web server. The application is developed using the AngularJS on client side and ASP.Net 5 on the server side. 

The application is designed as a single page application. The data for the query and analysis is obtained using the web service to directly get the data. None of the data is stored on the server side. The client side application login follows the Angular js.

The application uses the Angular JS charts to generate the charts and graphs for analysis. The d3j javascript library is used to render the charts. Additionally, the application is made responsive by using Bootstrap. Additionally, the charts and graphs generated by the Angular js charts are svg based and are also responsive.
